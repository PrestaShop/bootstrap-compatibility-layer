# Bootstrap compatibility layer
Bootstrap compatibility layer was created to make it easier to transition modules and themes from boostrap 4 to bootstrap 5.

## Installation
You can install the Bootstrap compatibility layer from your prefered package.
```yml
npm install bootstrap-compatibility-layer
# OR
yarn add bootstrap-compatibility-layer
# OR
pnpm add bootstrap-compatibility-layer
```
Or use it directly through our CDN:
```html
[...]
<link href="https://unpkg.com/bootstrap-compatibility-layer@1/dist/bootstrap-compatibility-layer.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
[...]
<script src="https://unpkg.com/bootstrap-compatibility-layer@1"></script>
[...]
```
To be sure that the scripts are all operational try to load the compatibility layer before the other scripts!
